INSTRUCTIONS:

Your goal is to build a Victory Plinth and slay 
the Leviathan (aka Bosscreep). Building cards makes
new stuff (good) but summons creeps (bad). 

- Left Click to examine a card
- Right Click to flip it (sorry trackpad users)
- Drag to the play field to build it and summon the creep
- Build the Victory Plinth and survive to win!

You can't completely block off your home row, that would
be too easy. Make sure to leave some space to build the
plinth.

Have a great day. You are awesome.
