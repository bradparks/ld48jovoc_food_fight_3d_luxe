EvoWord
--------

A 48 hour game by Joel Davis (joeld42@gmail.com) for the LudumDare 24 contest.

Source code is available at http://code.google.com/p/ld48jovoc/, this project
is in the ld24_evoword subdirectory (http://code.google.com/p/ld48jovoc/source/browse/#svn%2Fld24_evoword).

If you want the exact version submitted to the compo, it's revision r182 for the combo submission and
revision r185 for the subsequent windows port. 

Instructions
-------------
Explore the creature's genome by altering one letter at a time. Press RETURN to save
the creature in the next jar. When all jars are full, your game is complete and you
will see a diagram of the evolutionary path you took. When you jar a creature, you can
resume from any of the previously jarred creatures.

You may not use words previously used.

Scoring
--------
Letters are worth the following base point values:

1 Point : A E I N O R S T U 
2 Points: C D G H K L P
3 Points: B F M W Y
4 Points: J Q X Z

When you make a new word, you get the sum of the point values of the 
letters SQUARED! For example:

WORD = 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7 squared = 49 Points!

If you try to make a word and the word is wrong or you've already used the word, you
lose the base point value (not squared), e.g. 7 points in the example above
