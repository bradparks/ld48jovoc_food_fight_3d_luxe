<story title="The Test Level">

	<intro fg="ffffff" bg="E08E79">
		This is the preface to the test level. This level was merely a
		proto-thing, without the realness of an actual level but yet it
		called out, even in this incomplete state, to exist.
	</intro>

	<outro fg="774F38" bg="F1D4AF">
		Existing only briefly, the test level flickers and fades
		from our memory. Was it only a footnote to a fully developed
		game? Or does some part of the test level live on in the subliminal
		fabric of the game itself. Who can say? 
	</outro>
