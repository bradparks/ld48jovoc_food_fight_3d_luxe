Check out r214 if you want the exact submitted jam version, there may be

Created in (a bit over) 48 hours for the LudumDare Game Jam.

Not really playable but a good start, and it was fun to build. Ran out of time to 
implement combat, so right now you pass through the monsters. 

Arrow Keys - Move Player
P - Crazy camera spin mode
