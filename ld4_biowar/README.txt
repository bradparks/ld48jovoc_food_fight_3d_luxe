This was my incomplete entry for LD4. I gave up on this one
by the end of Saturday, and went on to make BadFood on sunday.

Just keeping this around for historical value, and because the
python embedding is pretty neat.

A note about the graphics, I went a little nuts on saturday going out
and taking photos for this, anticipating making a photoreal textured game.
Not a good use of contest time. :)
