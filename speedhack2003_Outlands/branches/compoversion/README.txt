DISCLAIMER:
This was written as part of the allegro speedhack 2003 competition. This means that
it was written within 72 hours. So it's pretty unpolished, there is no title screen
or (more importantly) computer or networked opponents. Hopefully, I'll get around to 
adding more features, but the gameplay itself is pretty solid. If you can find two
other people to play against, taking turns, it is pretty fun and challenging game.

=========
 Overview
=========

The different outland tribes each picked the landscape which suited them.
The sensible Grasslanders made their homes in the wind-swept plains, the
Seafarers, those playful gypsies, choose to live on the open sea. The rugged
and gruff Badlanders carved out a home in otherwise hostile terrain. Still,
each tribe did not live in isolation, and they each sought to increase their
own prosperity by establising trade routes between their own buildings and
even amongst the other tribes.

This is a tile-placement game, similar to Carcassonne or Toscana.
Each player tries to build large regions of their favorite landscape
and connect them together. Having a large region is nice, but having 
several well-connected smaller regions
can be even better.

==========
 Gameplay
==========

On their turn, a player may either:

- Place a tile
- Build a building

When it is not possible to place any more tiles, the game is over. If you can't 
find anywhere to place a tile, but the game hasn't ended, click the "show valid move"
button. It might not be a very good move, but still...

Placing tiles:
--------------

Pick a tile from the available ones. If there are two tiles in the
"Double Tile" box, you may place both in one turn.

A tile must touch a previously played tile somewhere. If the tile has road
connections, they must line up. A building can line up with an empty tile or
a road.

You can press "Right Mouse Button" to rotate tiles.

You can drop a tile back onto the tile pool if you want to change your mind.
If you choose a double tile, and drop the second one, your turn is over.

Buildings:
----------
You build a building somewhere on the land type you own. There must
be at least nine tiles in the region to build on it. You may place a building
on road or regular land, but it is usually smarter to place it somewhere on a
road.

You can press "Right Mouse Button" to cancel building a building.

=============
 Scoring
=============

A player gets points for each region they control. A region is a set of connected
tiles with a that player's building in it.

A region is worth:

region scoure = (Number of tiles in region) x (number of connected regions)

A connected region is any region that has a building in it with roads connecting
to a building in your region. 

Both your opponents regions and your other regions count for connection. However, 
it works both ways so connecting to your own regions will count twice for you, 
whereas connecting to your opponent's regions counts once for each. 

==============
 Strategy
==============

- many small connected regions will score higher than one large one. A large 
  region with many small connected "satelites" is even better.

- If an opponent has connected regions, try to use their land to join them, robbing
  them of the multiplying bonus.

- Cut off opponent's roads with empty space.

- Don't place buildings before their roads are complete.

- Always place buildings onto roads.
