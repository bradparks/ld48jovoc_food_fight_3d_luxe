         July Mini-LD Game

//// Introduction ////

    I woke up near the ocean. 
    I had no posessions, save for this journal.
    I couldn't even remember my name.
    So I started to explore...

There's really no objective to this game (and at 
this point, not much at all to do). The intention
was to make kind of a free-form fantasy RPG but 
this is only a fraction of what I had in mind. 

//// Controls ////

Use arrows or mouse to move.
Use RMB to scroll the view (clunky, I know).

Collect bubbles. Each bubble contains a chunk of landscape.
You may add the landscape to the world by pressing
a number from 1 to 5. The new land will be created centered
on your current location. You may not carry more than five
chunks of land.

Visit another humanoid and they will join your party,
and follow you on your adventure.

There are critters on the island. They wander about, foraging 
for food. They are harmless (for now).

Debug Keys (Cheats)
F11 - Enable debug keys
F5 - Show selection map (not very useful)
F6 - Change player's identity
F7 - Get a bubble

//// Discussion ////

The random characters and critters are generated by the
"pixelrobot" algorithm by Dave Bollinger. Although in this
world they are not robots, they are fantasy creatures.

This was inspired by a previous LD entry from MrPiglet.

Enjoy the game. There's only a fraction of what I had in mind
implemented, hopefully I'll finish it but given my track record
probably won't. Email ideas (and encouragement) to joeld42@yahoo.com
if you like the game, and feel free to add more land chunks or 
tile sprites (see land.txt and tiletmpl.txt to get started) and
I will include them in any future releases.
